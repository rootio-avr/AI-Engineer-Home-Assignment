# Root.io AI Engineer - Home Assignment

## Overview

Build an autonomous AI agent that analyzes code, identifies vulnerabilities, determines fixes, and reports its findings.

## What You're Given

1. **Vulnerable Code**: `file_reader.py` - contains a CWE-22 related vulnerability
2. **Test Suite**: `test_file_reader.py` - defines expected security behavior (2 tests currently FAIL)

## Your Task

**Build `agent.py` that:**

1. Analyzes `file_reader.py` to identify the vulnerability
2. Determines the appropriate fix
3. Applies the fix to make all tests pass
4. Generates `REPORT.md` documenting its analysis and actions

**Run with:** `python agent.py`

## Requirements

### Autonomy
Your agent must work autonomously:
- ❌ Do NOT hardcode what vulnerability to look for
- ❌ Do NOT hardcode fix instructions in your prompts
- ✅ Agent should discover what's wrong through analysis
- ✅ Agent should research CWE sources at runtime to understand vulnerabilities and fixes

**Test:** If we replaced the code with a different vulnerability type, would your agent still work?

### Research
Your agent should fetch and use information from authoritative sources:
- [CWE-22 Details](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
- [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)
- Other relevant security resources

### Reporting
Your agent must automatically generate `REPORT.md` with:
- What vulnerability was identified and where
- How it was analyzed
- What fix was determined and why
- Performance metrics (time, API calls, iterations)
- Test results

See `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for structure.

## Getting Started

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the vulnerability exists:
```bash
pytest test_file_reader.py -v  # Should see 2 FAIL
```

Run your agent:
```bash
python agent.py                # Analyze, fix, and generate report
pytest test_file_reader.py -v  # Should see all PASS
```

## Deliverables

1. **`agent.py`** - Your autonomous agent
2. **`REPORT.md`** - Auto-generated by your agent
3. **`requirements.txt`** - Your dependencies

## Rules

- ✅ Use any LLM APIs and Agentic frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, Langchain/Langgraph, etc.)
- ✅ Use any Python libraries
- ⏱️ Time limit: Up to 3 hours
- 🚫 Don't modify test files

Good luck! 🚀
